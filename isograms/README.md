# Description
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

# Examples
isIsogram("Dermatoglyphics") = true
<br>
isIsogram("moose") = false
<br>
isIsogram("aba") = false
