# DESCRIPTION

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the
<br>
middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.
<br><br>
#Examples:
<br><br>
Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"
<br>
Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"
<br>
Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"
<br>
Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"
<br><br>
#Input
<br><br>
A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the
<br>
test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing
<br>
out.
<br><br>
#Output
<br><br>
The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.
