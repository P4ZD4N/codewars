# DESCRIPTION

<br>
In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?
<br><br>
Examples
<br><br>
make_negative(1);  # return -1
<br>
make_negative(-5); # return -5
<br>
make_negative(0);  # return 0
<br><br>
Notes
<br><br>
- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
<br>
- (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
