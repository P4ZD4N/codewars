# Description
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

# Examples
Kata.findUniq(new double[]{ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 }); // => 2
<br>
Kata.findUniq(new double[]{ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 }); // => 0.55
<br><br>
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.
<br><br>
The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
