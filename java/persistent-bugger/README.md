# Decsription
Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

# Examples
39 --> 3 (because 3x9 = 27, 2x7 = 14, 1x4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit)
<br>
999 --> 4 (because 9x9x9 = 729, 7x2x9 = 126, 1x2x6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2)
<br>
4 --> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number)
